# pidof

This is a simple standalone version of pidof from the systemv tools.

It was stripped down to only pidof by Abdul Mateen. His version can be found
at https://code.google.com/p/secured/source/browse/src/pidof.c.

I modified Abdul's version to make is still be a stand alone executable.

This code is still under the GPLv2 license.

To build and install the code:
> make

> make install DESTDIR=&lt;base location&gt;
